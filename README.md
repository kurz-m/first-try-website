# First Website created from Scratch

This is my first website which I created from scratch using HTML and CSS for styling the website and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy it. This is part of my journey through the OpenAppAcademy I am doing during my free time.

## Different parts of the website

### Header
The header is created as a navigation bar to navigate through the different pages of this website. It is also responsive and changes its layout when the screen gets narrower.
### Home
The body of the `Home` page is done using `display: grid` to provide even columns for the 3 text boxes. Furthermore, I used `@media` queries to make a responsive layout, meaning that the 1x3 (rows _x_ columns) changes to a 3x1 on smaller screens. For now the text are only placeholder and will be filled in the future with data.

### Useful Tools
On the `Useful Tools` page, I played around with inserting an unordered list and links to tools I find helpful in many areas. I also used `display: grid` to get 2 even columns which also change to a mobile layout when the screen gets narrower.

### Running
On the `Running` page, I played around with the `<iframes>` method to implement other data from another website into my own website. Furthermore, I used the `grid-template-areas` to provide a responsive layout.

### Contact
On the `Contact` page, I inserted a `<form>` element in order to produce a contact form. Right now it is not functioning because the website is static. It is also styled in a responsive way and changes layout and font size when the screen width gets narrower.
